Depth/Distance Weighting
========================

Here the code **pfweight_60.exe** and the input file **pfweight.inp** is used to generate distance weighting for the inversion. Files relevant to this part of the example are in the sub-folder *pfweights*. Before running this example, you may want to do the following:

	- `Download and open the zip folder containing the entire gg3d v6 example <https://github.com/ubcgif/gg3d/raw/master/assets/gg3d_v6_example.zip>`__ (if not done already)
	- Learn how to :ref:`run pfweight <gg3d_pfweight>`
	- Learn the format of the :ref:`input file <gg3d_weight_input>`


Here is the input file for **pfweight_60.exe**
